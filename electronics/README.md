# PPG sensor electronics
Here are a bunch of hardware prototypes to explore how to make a working PPG sensor.
## Electronic versions
* [Sensor version V1.0](https://github.com/Squantor/PPG_sensor_research/tree/master/electronics/Sensor_V1.0) is the first hardware iteration, this is to create a final hardware layout for the sensor and measure it.
* Sensor version V2.0 contains everything from 1.0 but with all the unneeded research components stripped. Additionally: USB to serial converter, Serial flash for datastorage, accelerometer for data storage and battery charger controller.
* Sensor version V3.0 contains everything from 2.0 but now in a portable form factor.
