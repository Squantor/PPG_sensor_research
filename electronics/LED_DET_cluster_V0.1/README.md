# Prototyping 4 LED PPG sensor cluster
Simple breakout for the 4 led PPG sensor cluster. Contains footprints for 6 leds, but a maximum of 4 can be populated, or 6 if you get creative? Just to try out various LED/sensor configurations.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* Flexible LED footprint, from 0603 LED to OSRAM PointLED (top mount)
* Flexible detector footprint, from 0603 Phototransistor to OSRAM SHF2440
